\section tone_generation_page_sec_1 What does it do?
The tone generation module provides for the generation of cadenced tones,
suitable for a wide range of telephony applications. 

\section tone_generation_page_sec_2 How does it work?
Oscillators are a problem. They oscillate due to instability, and yet we need
them to behave in a stable manner. A look around the web will reveal many papers
on this subject. Many describe rather complex solutions to the problem. However,
we are only concerned with telephony applications. It is possible to generate
the tones we need with a very simple efficient scheme. It is also practical to
use an exhaustive test to prove the oscillator is stable under all the
conditions in which we will use it.
